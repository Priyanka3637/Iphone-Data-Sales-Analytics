# iPhone Sales in India Analysis

This project aims to analyze the sales of iPhones in India using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset provides valuable insights into the sales trends of iPhones on Flipkart, a popular e-commerce platform in India.

## Project Highlights üë®‚Äçüíª

Here are some key takeaways from the analysis of iPhone sales in India:

1. **Most Appreciated iPhone**: The APPLE iPhone 8 Plus (Gold, 64 GB) received the highest level of appreciation among iPhone models in India. This indicates that the specific features and attributes of this model were highly valued by Indian consumers.

2. **Price Influence**: iPhones with lower sale prices tend to have higher sales in India. This suggests that affordability plays a significant role in driving consumer demand for iPhones in the Indian market.

3. **Discount Impact**: iPhones with high discounts attract more sales in India. The availability of discounts and promotions seems to be an effective strategy for increasing iPhone sales in the country.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and contains comprehensive information about iPhone sales in India on Flipkart. It includes various attributes such as iPhone models, prices, discounts, ratings, and customer reviews.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data**: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `apple_products.csv`

- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating insights. The notebooks are named accordingly.

- **Reports**: This directory stores the generated reports and visualizations. It includes graphs, charts, and summary findings derived from the analysis.

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the structure of the repository.

## Project Summary:
  
** *Apple¬†iPhones¬†are among the top-selling smartphones worldwide. There is huge competition among smartphone brands in India, where you can get the latest technology in a smartphone at half the price of an iPhone. Still, there are high sales of iPhones in India. So if you want to analyze the sales of iPhones in India, this article is for you. In this project, I will take you through the task of iPhone Sales Analysis using Python.
For the iPhone sales analysis task, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle containing data about the sales of iPhones in India on Flipkart. It will be an ideal dataset to analyze the sales of iPhones in India.¬†
